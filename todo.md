### 1. The "Hero" Section (First Impression)
   This is what the client sees immediately. It must answer: "Who is this and are they available?"

Avatar: High-res image.

Display Name: Full name or Username.

Professional Headline: e.g., "Senior Backend Engineer (Node.js/Go)" or "React Native Specialist".

Availability Status: (Critical for recruiters)

🟢 Available for new projects

🟡 Open to offers (Passive)

🔴 Busy / Not looking

Hourly Rate / Salary Expectation: e.g., "$50/hr" or "$80k/yr".

Location & Timezone: e.g., "Berlin, Germany (UTC+1)". Clients need to know overlap hours.

### 2. The "About" Section (The Pitch)
   Bio/Summary: A markdown-supported text block where they describe their passion, soft skills, and working style.

Years of Experience: Calculated automatically from their first job or manually set (e.g., "7 Years").

Video Introduction (Optional but Trending): A 1-2 minute Loom/YouTube embed where they introduce themselves. This builds massive trust.

### 3. The "Tech Stack" (The Filter)
   Don't just use a text block here. Store these as Tags or Relations so clients can filter by them (e.g., "Find me a Geek who knows NestJS").

Primary Skills (Expert): Top 3-5 skills (e.g., React, Node.js, AWS).

Secondary Skills (Competent): (e.g., Docker, Postgres, Redis).
